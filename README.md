# Django Dashboard 
# A dashboard is category of GUI interface that’s intended to show a
# “big picture” or “at-a-glance” perspective on some topic. The term
# comes from dashboards on vehicles, which provide an “at-a-glance”
# perspective on the speed, fuel, milage, RPM, and other important
# information for the vehicle. Dashboards are often used in analytics
# software (to show popularity of a website or app), content management
# software (for a birds-eye view on what’s to be published), business
# software (to monitor performance indicators of an organization), to
# name a few.
